# What is this?
This project was developed by me during my degree in Bioinformatics in the curricular unit Programming Languages I. 
The teacher asked to create a schedule that had a menu with the following options:
    1 - Add a new client
    2 - Associate a contact to a client
    3 - Associate a DNA sequence to a client
    4 - Test the DNA gene
    5 - Remove a contact of a client
    6 - Consult the schedule
    7 - Save the data to a file
    8 - Read the data from a file
    0 - Leave the program. 

# What I learned?
With this project, I acquired some basic knowledge about, one of the most demanding programming languages 
in nowadays, python. I've learned with this project how to use dictionaries, lists and functions. 
I hope it can be useful in the near future.
